    "\n",
    "Welcome to lab! Please read this lab in its entirety, as the analysis will make a lot more sense with the background context provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is intended to be a hands-on introduction to data science as it can be applied to SES (socio-economic status). \n",
    "\n",
    "SES is often measured in variables of salary, parental education, occupation status, and other factors. Historically, income has been treated as the defining factor of SES, and there have been many research studies showing that SES as defined by income is the leading factor for school performance in test scores. If you are interested in learning more, you can visit the American Psychological Association to see more research: http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/education.aspx\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to suggest using real-world data that this may not be the case. We are going to give you the chance to explore and toggle between different variables to define SES and how much importance to assign to each variable. **Data science is not just about plugging in the numbers, it is about making many decisions and backing up those decisions with quantitative reasoning.** This can have implications later in how the world treats SES and public policy suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we are going to suggest that the defining variable for SES might not even be income, but rather family wealth, that provides a more accurate prediction for school performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no standard method of measuring SES. In this lab, we are going to define SES in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SES is a positive number that represents the ratio: $\\displaystyle \\frac {\\text{individual SES}} {\\text{median US SES}}$   where 1 means that this individual is exactly at the median SES. This number will always be positive because we are assuming that there will be no cases of negative wealth.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. individual SES is a number such that \n",
    "\n",
    "$SES = p_i * \\text{income score} + p_e * \\text{years of education}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_i$ is the importance we assign to income on a scale of 0 to 1 and $p_e$ is the importance we assign to years of education on a scale of 0 to 1. Throughout this lab we will be changing the values of $p_i$ and $p_e$ but it is important to remember that these values *must add up to 1*. Our default values at first are $p_i$ = 0.8 and $p_e$ = 0.2.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Income score is a score assigned to each income bracket to ensure that all our factors are on the same scale. Our income scores are defined as follows:\n",
